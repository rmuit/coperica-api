            I make an effort to keep lines under 120 characters, except:
            - function declarations, which I don't split into multiple lines
            - exceptions thrown, where I don't split the message into a
              variable just to keep the line length OK.
            I might change my mind one day but I don't think that improves
            readability, and I don't think a line length check is very
            necessary in general, as long as we can keep the 'real code'
            adhering to a rough standard.

            "Visibility must be declared on all constants if your project
            supports PHP 7.1 or later". - this seems weird to me. Should this
            warning not be triggered only if the _minimum_ version is 7.1?
            That is apparently not the case right now.
